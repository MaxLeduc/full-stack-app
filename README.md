# Full Stack Starter

## Development
When developing you will be needing `node` and `npm` locally installed on your machine.

### Frontend
To start the frontend React application use the `yarn start` command.

### Backend
To start the backend node application you can use the `yarn dev` command, which will also enable hot-reloading.

You can also use the `yarn build` and `yarn start` to statically serve the application.

## Docker
To start the application (full stack) by using docker, run the following commands:

```
$ docker-compose build
$ docker-compose up -d
```
